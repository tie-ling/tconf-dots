#+title: generate gpg key and add ssh key

* Generate gpg key
First, generate key normally
#+begin_src
[yc@hp-840g3:~]$ gpg --gen-key

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Yuchen Guo
Email address: gyuchen86@gmail.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Yuchen Guo <gyuchen86@gmail.com>"
#+end_src
* Do not use GPG for SSH
It is not worth the additional complexity.
You have to fiddle with the gpgagent for the gpg-ssh key to work.

Use a simple ssh key with passphrase instead!
* Remember: Backup GNUPGHOME
=tar acf gnupg.tar.xz ~/.gnupg=
